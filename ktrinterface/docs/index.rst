Documentation fo ktrinterface
=============================

ktrinterface provides a high-level API to the Ziena KNITRO solver. The primary function made available with this package is `ktrsolve` which can be used in a similar manner to other common optimization routines (for example, `minimize` in the Scipy optimization module).

Although `ktrsolve` calls the official KNITRO Python API, the author is unaffiliated with Ziena or any of KNITRO's distributors.
